# Python-Repository

Havent yet given any description since i started this repo. the first number of scripts are actually codes from the book Beginning Python from novice to pro 3rd edition and through them i was able to successfully go through chapter 1 to 5. Each exercise explains a particular section or subtopic in the book. enjoy!

The next one i just commit today is the project Calculator.py which was given to all of us. It has the basic function of performing basic mathematical operations, respecting BODMAS and also contains a memory for the previous calculation operation. In this script i tried to merge all concerpts gathered and understood from chapter 1 to chapter 5. Thanks.
